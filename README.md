# Recify is a web app that made with Vanilla Javascript.
## With this project, i was able to interact with real world API's, i used axios to fetch and displayed food recipes asychronously.
## I then used modern tools like webpack to bundle javascripts modules and also used babel to convert ES6 codes and above codes to ES5, used package.json to manage all my dependecies.
## I also learnt how to use webpack to configure my dev server, so that when i save any code, it will reload automatically.
## I also learnt how to use the Local Storage API to save recipe favourites.
